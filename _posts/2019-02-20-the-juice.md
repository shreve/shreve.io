A former coworker of mine used to talk about "the juice" and "juicing up" our work. What he meant was making sure all our individual interests were aligned along our work.

Having a job means you're getting paid and that's at least one interest being fulfulled, but what else could your work be doing for you? Do you enjoy working on what you're working on? Are you learning from it? Could you be writing open source code which could gain you some degree of prestige? Is it helping you get where you want to be in life?

The essence of juice is getting the most out of what you do. Don't settle for "just a job" when you could be getting a 4x multiplier out of every day.
