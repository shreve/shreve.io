<p>These are things I want, if you happen to want to buy me
things üòÅ</p>

* [The Leaf Razor Kit](https://leafshave.com/products/the-leaf-kit)
  <br><span class="tag">Color: Mercury</span>
  I'm really into this specific razor because it takes the classic principals of
  minimalism from safety razors and adapts them into a modern design.

* [ECOXGEAR Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker](https://www.costco.com/ecoedge-pro-waterproof-speaker-by-ecoxgear.product.100987334.html)
  <br><span class="tag">Color: Blue</span>
  This specific model isn't necessarily important, but this is exactly what I'm
  looking for -- bluetooth, waterproof, and rugged

* [American Giant Classic Full Zip Hoodie](https://www.american-giant.com/products/womens-classic-full-zip-wisteria)
  <br><span class="tag">Size: XL</span> <span class="tag">Color: Wisteria</span>
  American Giant's entire production line is based in the United States and
  their garments are designed to last.

* Bath and Body Works Soaps
  <br><span class="tag">Scent: Kitchen Lemon</span> but I also like most fruity
  scents.

* A bath pillow
  <br>I've been taking a lot more baths, and I would love a waterproof pillow to
  keep my head comfy.

* Fuzzy socks
  <br><span class="tag">Size: 12</span> I have found this challenging because
  I wear a women's size 12 and most fuzzy socks I've seen only go up to size 10.

* A light therapy lamp
  <br><span class="tag">Lux: 10K or greater</span> These early nights have
  really been taking a toll on me already. A therapy lamp should help to keep me
  sane through the rest of the winter.

* Scrub Daddies
  <br>I have decided that these sponges are the new best way to do the dishes by
  hand.

* A sticker notebook
  <br>A notebook filled with blank pages of the waxy backing paper for stickers.
  This allows you to keep and collect stickers rather than placing them.

* Organization for makeup and jewelry
  <br>I'm currently just using plastic baskets/containers to store all my makeup
  and jewelry: earrings, necklaces, nail polish bottles, tubes, pens, etc.
  "There's got to be a better way!"

* A leather cross-body bag
  <br><span class="tag">Color: Cognac</span> Honestly, I'm not sure exactly
  what I want beyond a bag larger than a clutch, but smaller than
  a backpack. Here are a few bags that I like and could serve as inspiration,
  sort of like a mini Pinterest board:

  - [Coach Willis Bag](https://www.coach.com/products/vintage-classic-willis-bag/CL627.html)
  - [LightningDesign Crossbody Bag](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1044227449/personalized-leather-mini-crossbody-bag)
  - [Hide N Craft Crossbody Purse](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B07BHD25D4)


## For Joel

* [13" Multipet Duckworth](https://www.multipet.com/product/duckworth/)
  <br>This toy is seriously Joel's favorite. A yellow one was the first toy he
  ever bonded with, and he's gone through at least a dozen of them in his
  life. They're available at most stores that sell dog toys: Walmart, Menards,
  Chewy, Amazon, even Bed Bath & Beyond.

* [Zuke's Mini Natural Treats](https://www.zukes.com/dog-treats-and-chews/training/mini-naturals-chicken-recipe)
  <br>We go through these treats like crazy. Joel likes any flavor, but I'd
  prefer to not get the salmon ones -- they're incredibly fishy.

* [Greenies Dental Chews](https://www.greenies.com/)
  <br><span class="tag">Size: Regular</span> Joel eats a lot of these, too. They
  help with the gnarly breath, and he likes chewing on them.
