<p>These are things I want, if you happen to want to buy me
things üòÅ</p>

* [The Leaf Razor Kit](https://leafshave.com/products/the-leaf-kit)
  <br><span class="tag">Color: Mercury</span>
  I'm really into this specific razor because it takes the classic principals of
  minimalism from safety razors and adapts them into a modern design.

* [ECOXGEAR Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker](https://www.costco.com/ecoedge-pro-waterproof-speaker-by-ecoxgear.product.100987334.html)
  <br><span class="tag">Color: Blue</span>
  This specific model isn't necessarily important, but this is exactly what I'm
  looking for -- bluetooth, waterproof, and rugged

* [American Giant Classic Full Zip Hoodie](https://www.american-giant.com/products/womens-classic-full-zip-wisteria)
  <br><span class="tag">Size: XL</span> <span class="tag">Color: Wisteria</span>
  American Giant's entire production line is based in the United States and
  their garments are designed to last.

* Bath and Body Works Soaps
  <br><span class="tag">Scent: Kitchen Lemon</span> but I also like most fruity
  scents.

* Scrub Daddies
  <br>I have decided that these sponges are the new best way to do the dishes by
  hand.

* A sticker notebook
  <br>A notebook filled with blank pages of the waxy backing paper for stickers.
  This allows you to keep and collect stickers rather than placing them.

* Organization for makeup and jewelry
  <br>I'm currently just using plastic baskets/containers to store all my makeup
  and jewelry: earrings, necklaces, nail polish bottles, tubes, pens, etc.
  "There's got to be a better way!"

* A leather messenger bag
  <br><span class="tag">Color: Brown</span> I know Coach is overly expensive,
  and this particular model is hard to find, but the `A7E-9927` is my
  reference model.
